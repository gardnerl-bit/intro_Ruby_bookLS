# 1.)The first example will put the result of 3 because 
# x is initialized on the outer scope. Then it is resigned 
# its value inside the #times method. The value is adding
# 1 each time, therefor the final x value will be 3 after 
# iterating x 3 times.

# 2.) the x varible will print out an error due to the local (x) varible not being 
# initialized on the outer scope. (undefined local varible or method)
